# A collection of LaTeX resources 

## At MetOs we (currently) have 
- [Template](https://github.com/MetOs-UiO/TeXTemplate-PhD-thesis-MetOs) for PhD-thesis 
- [Template](https://github.com/MetOs-UiO/uio_geo_poster_template) for poster setup 

## New to TeX? 
It could be an excellent idea to check-out 
- An [introduction to LaTeX](https://github.com/uio-latex/Introduction-to-LaTeX)
